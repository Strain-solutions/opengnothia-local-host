## Why OpenGnothia?

Mental health support should be accessible, private, and personalized. OpenGnothia combines the power of modern AI with evidence-based therapeutic approaches to create a self-therapy companion that lives entirely on your device.

- **Your data never leaves your device** — all sessions, journal entries, and insights are stored locally in SQLite
- **Choose your therapeutic approach** — from Psychoanalysis to CBT, Stoicism to Schema Therapy
- **Bring your own AI** — works with Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or any compatible API endpoint
- **Open source and transparent** — review every line of code that handles your most personal thoughts

> **Note:** OpenGnothia is a self-exploration tool, not a replacement for professional mental health care. If you are in crisis, please reach out to a licensed professional or crisis helpline.

## Features

### Redesigned Dashboard
A hero session card surfaces your current or next session, ritual cards track your journal and dream streaks, and an icon-based mood slider lets you log a daily check-in without leaving the home screen.

### AI Therapy Sessions
Engage in meaningful conversations with an AI therapist that adapts to your chosen therapeutic approach. Sessions include real-time streaming responses, session timers, opt-in AI summaries, and session-closure proposals where the AI signals a natural stopping point.

### Clinical Intake Form
Complete an optional 10-question wizard that captures your background, goals, and current stressors — with auto-save as you go. The intake is injected as context into every AI session so therapy feels continuous from the first message.

### In-Session Insights Panel
Capture observations mid-session without breaking flow. Your own notes and AI-proposed insights appear in a side panel; accept the ones that resonate and they're saved to your insights library.

### Journal
Write and reflect on your daily thoughts. Each entry supports mood tagging and optional AI analysis to help you identify patterns and gain deeper understanding of your experiences.

### Dream Analysis
Record your dreams and explore their meaning with AI-assisted interpretation. Build a searchable dream diary to track recurring symbols and themes over time.

### Mood Tracking & Check-ins
Track your daily mood, energy levels, and sleep quality. View your emotional patterns on a calendar with visual mood indicators to understand your mental health trends.

### AI-Generated Insights
Receive AI-generated insights drawn from your sessions and journal entries. Organize them into groups, pin important ones, and revisit them as your self-understanding deepens.

### Breathing Exercises
Access guided breathing techniques to manage stress and anxiety. Multiple breathing patterns are available to suit different needs and moments.

### Therapy Programs
Follow structured therapy programs that guide your self-discovery journey with progressive exercises and reflections.

### Multi-Provider AI Support
Bring your own API key and choose from a wide range of models:
- **Anthropic Claude** — Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 (with extended thinking / adaptive budget)
- **OpenAI** — GPT-5.4 (+ Mini, Pro), GPT-5.3, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o families
- **Custom endpoints** — Connect any OpenAI-compatible API

### Privacy & Security
- All data stored locally in SQLite — no cloud sync, no telemetry
- Biometric lock with Touch ID support (macOS)
- Password protection
- API keys stored only on your device, sent only to the provider you choose

### Multi-Language
Available in English and Turkish, with an extensible internationalization system.

| **Logotherapy** | Viktor Frankl | Finding meaning in life, even in unavoidable suffering |
| **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)** | Steven C. Hayes | Psychological flexibility, values-aligned living |
| **Schema Therapy** | Jeffrey Young | Identifying and transforming early maladaptive schemas |
| **Stoicism (Philosophical Counseling)** | Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca | Inner peace, virtue, and rational response to life |

---

**Data Flow:**
```
User ──> React UI ──> Zustand Store ──> Tauri Commands ──> SQLite (local)
                          │
                          └──> AI Service ──> Anthropic / OpenAI / Custom API
```

All data stays on the user's device. The only external communication is with the AI provider of your choice, using your own API key.
